## Meso Context {.smaller}
### Statistical Models is part of the Data Science Pathway

![](images/meso.png){width=70%}


::: {.notes}

Statistical Models is a Y2 Model in T2
It is part of Data Science Pathway

It builds on Probability & Statistics which is a compulsory module in Year 1 T2.

General understanding from other foundational Year 1 modules 
is also required: Calculus and Linear Algebra.

Follow up optional modules in Year 3 which belong 
to Data Science Pathway are:
- Numerical Computation (since this module focusses on statistical software)
- Data Science (which builds directly on the techniques learned in Statistical Models)

:::



## Macro Context {.smaller}

- **Statistical Models** is part of **BSc in Mathematics**

- BSc in Mathematics meets standards of the
    * Quality Assurance Agency (QAA)
    * As detailed in the [Subject Benchmark Statement](https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/sbs/sbs-mathematics-statistics-and-operational-research-23.pdf?sfvrsn=5c71a881_12) for **MSOR**
    * **MSOR:** Mathematics, Statistics & Operations Research

- BSc in Mathematics is accredited by
    * Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA)
    * IMA accredits courses which meet its [requirements](https://ima.org.uk/university-degree-programme-accreditation/)
    * Graduates attain the **IMA Chartered Mathematician status**

|:-----                  |:-----                         |
|  Coursework Portfolio  | 70%                           |
|  Homework              | 30%                           |


Evaluation Framework:

- Inclusive Education Framework Checklist ([Link](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/ld.php?content_id=33865361))


Analysis backed by:

- **Inclusive Education** resources from the University of Hull ([Link](https://www.hull.ac.uk/special/inclusive-education)) 

- Inclusive Assessment, Marking & Feedback Policy ([Link](https://www.hull.ac.uk/choose-hull/university-and-region/key-documents/docs/inclusive-assessment-marking-and-feedback-policy.pdf))



## Inclusive Education Framework Checklist {.smaller}

![](images/IEF_Checklist.png){width=80%}


## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example #1

`Students are given choices within their assessments to allow for personalisation`

- 10 Worksheets: marked and returned to students with feedback
- Maths Department Policy: Students allowed to miss small # of Worksheets  
*(avoiding the University’s mitigating circumstances process)*
- Allows students freedom to prioritise their preferred topics  
*(all topics are eventuallu assessed via Coursework at the end of the module)*

In line with [Hull's Inclusive Education Framework](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/inclusiveeducationframework/Assessment-and-Feedback)

- **Be mindful of student workload and anxieties around assessment**
 


## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example #2

`Module uses a range of assessment formats`


1. 10 weekly Worksheets:
    * Purpose: To provide continuous summative and formative feedback
    * Each Worksheet accounts for a low percentage of final grade 
    * Including low-stakes regular assessments is an inclusive assessment for learning practice


    


## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Good example #2

`Module uses a range of assessment formats`


2. Coursework Portfolio:
    * Perform statistical analyses of real-world datasets
    * Report + Discuss statistical analyses 
    * Exactly the same as statisticians working in industry would have to do
    * Opportunity to demonstrate depth of understanding

In line with [Hull's Inclusive Education Framework](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/inclusiveeducationframework/Assessment-and-Feedback)

- **Give students authentic opportunities to demonstrate their skills, knowledge and self-awareness**


## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Area of Enhancement

`Mathematics assessment is designed at the programme level,   giving students a manageable assessment load`

- Mathematics assessment is **indeed** designed at the programme level

- Managing assessment load is **tricky** 
    * Due to inherently high amount of content for Maths disciplines
    * Partly due to limited staff and high turnover



## Highlights of Evaluation {.smaller}
### Area of Enhancement

`Mathematics assessment is designed at the programme level,   giving students a manageable assessment load`

- Statistical Models students in T2 had:
    * At least 1 more module with 10 Weekly Assignments
    * At least 1 more module with Coursework due in last week

- Mitigating these issues:
    * Best 7 Weekly Assignments count  
    *([Hull IEF](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/inclusiveeducationframework/Assessment-and-Feedback) + Maths Department Policy)*
    * Coursework made available at beginning of T2  
    *(Point 5 of [Inclusive Assessment, Marking & Feedback Policy](https://www.hull.ac.uk/choose-hull/university-and-region/key-documents/docs/inclusive-assessment-marking-and-feedback-policy.pdf))*

## Approach for evaluation

- evaluated curriculum against SDGs and ESD competencies

- My module’s Programme Competencies map closely to ESD competencies 1, 4 & 7 (explain how these are taught and assessed, note intent to articulate this mapping to students)

- SDGs already present in my module:
4 Quality Education (use principles of TP to evidence)
16 Peace and Justice (explain case study activity, note positive student feedback)


- Plan to expand case studies for students to select from several appropriate SDG-aligned themes (e.g. SDG 5, 8, 12)

- Research staff/student co-design initiatives for SDG module integration

- ESD5 (collaborative working) could suit my module – explore recent pedagogic innovations in my discipline
