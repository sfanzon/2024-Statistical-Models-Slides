## What is R? {.smaller}

- R is a *high-level* programming language (like **Python**) 
- This means R deals automatically with some details of computer execution:
  * Memory allocation
  * Resources allocation
- R is focused on manipulating and analyzing data

## Installing R {.smaller}

- R is freely available on Windows, Mac OS and Linux
- To install:
  * Download R from CRAN [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org)
  * Make sure you choose the right version for your system
  * Follow the instructions to install






## How to use R? {.smaller}

- We have installed R. What now?

- The R console can be booted in two ways:
  * Find the **R application** on your machine
  * Open a terminal, type **R**, exectute






## R application {.smaller}

## What can R do?  {.smaller}

- R is waiting for commands
    * Commands can be typed after the symbol $\, >$
    * Press enter to execute a command
    * To exit R, type $q()$ and enter
    * R will ask if you want to *save the workspace*
    * By saying yes, the workspace will be saved until next session





## Example {.smaller}
### Few lines of code can lead to impressive results 

**Example**: Plotting 1000 values randomly generated from normal distribution 

```{r}
#| echo: true
plot(rnorm(1000))
```




## R as a calculator {.smaller}
### R can perform basic mathematical operations

Below you can see R code and the corresponding answer

```{r}
#| echo: true

2+2
2*3-1
exp(-10)
log(2)
pi
sin(pi/2)

```




## Working Directory {.smaller}

- R session has a working directory associated with it 
- Unless specified, R will use a **default** working directory
- To check the location of the working directory, use the ``getwd`` function
- On my MacOS system I get $\qquad$
![](images/r_working_directory.png){width=32%}

- File paths are always enclosed in double quotation marks
- Note that R uses **forward slashes** (not backslashes) for paths
- You can change the default working directory using the function ```setwd```

```r
setwd("/folder1/folder2/folder3/")

```

- File path can be relative to current working directory or full (system root drive)



## Comments {.smaller}

- It is good practice to **document** your code
- This means adding comments directly in the code
- Comments should be brief and explain what a chunk of code does
- To insert a comment just preface the line with a hash mark \#

```{r}
#| echo: true

# This is a comment in R
# Comments are ignored by R

1+1 # This works out the result of one plus one!
```



## R Packages {.smaller}

- The base installation of R comes ready with:
  * Commands for numeric calculations
  * Common statistical analyses
  * Plotting and visualization
  
- More specialized techniques and data sets are contained in **packages** (libraries)

- **Installing packages**

- **Loading packages**




## Plotting random numbers {.smaller}

Let us go back to the example of the command 
``plot(rnorm(1000))``

The function ``rnorm(n)`` outputs $n$ randomly generated numbers from $N(0,1)$

```{r}
#| echo: true
rnorm(5)
```

These can then be plotted by concatenating the plot command

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
plot(rnorm(5))
```

**Note**: 

- The values plotted (next slide) are, for sure, different from the ones listed above

- This is because every time you call ``rnorm(5)`` new values are generated

- We need to **store** the generated values if we want to re-use them

## R Scripts {.smaller}




## Data {.smaller}


- Just think of R or any other software package as a computer that's too big to fit in your pocket!
$\bullet$ Two basic ways of reading data into R
\begin{enumerate}
\item Directly via the command line for trivial lecture examples
\item Read in using the \texttt{read.table} command via the command line from a .txt file in notepad saved to your USB\\
$\quad$ \textbf{-} Need to be able to write down the filepath. This is usually shortest and easiest if saved to a USB stick\\
$\quad$ \textbf{-} The .txt file that includes the data has to contain equal numbers of evenly spaced columns. This can get a bit fiddly in large problems.
\end{enumerate}
