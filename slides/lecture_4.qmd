## What is R? {.smaller}

- R is a *high-level* programming language (like **Python**) 
- This means R deals automatically with some details of computer execution:
  * Memory allocation
  * Resources allocation
- R is focused on manipulating and analyzing data




## Installing R {.smaller}

- R is freely available on Windows, Mac OS and Linux
- To install:
  * Download R at this link [https://cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org)
  * Make sure you choose the right version for your system
  * Follow the instructions to install






## How to use R? {.smaller}

- We have installed R. What now?

- The R console can be booted in two ways:
  * Find the **R application** on your machine
  * Open a terminal, type **R**, exectute






## R application {.smaller}
### This is how the R prompt looks on the Mac OS app

## What can R do?  {.smaller}

- R is waiting for commands
    * Commands can be typed after the symbol $\, >$
    * Press enter to execute a command
    * To exit R, type $q()$ and enter
    * R will ask if you want to *save the workspace*
    * By saying yes, the workspace will be saved until next session





## Example {.smaller}
### Few lines of code can lead to impressive results 

**Example**: Plotting 1000 values randomly generated from normal distribution 

```{r}
#| echo: true
plot(rnorm(1000))
```




## R as a calculator {.smaller}

R can perform basic mathematical operations:

- Below you can see R code
- and the corresponding answer given by R

```{r}
#| echo: true

2+2
2*3-1
exp(-10)
log(15)
pi
sin(pi/2)

```



## Plotting random numbers {.smaller}

Let us go back to the example of the command 
``plot(rnorm(1000))``

The function ``rnorm(n)`` outputs $n$ randomly generated numbers from $N(0,1)$

```{r}
#| echo: true
rnorm(5)
```

These can then be plotted by concatenating the plot command

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
plot(rnorm(5))
```

**Note**: 

- The values plotted (next slide) are, for sure, different from the ones listed above

- This is because every time you call ``rnorm(5)`` new values are generated

- We need to **store** the generated values if we want to re-use them



## Assignments {.smaller}


## Data {.smaller}


- Just think of R or any other software package as a computer that's too big to fit in your pocket!
$\bullet$ Two basic ways of reading data into R
\begin{enumerate}
\item Directly via the command line for trivial lecture examples
\item Read in using the \texttt{read.table} command via the command line from a .txt file in notepad saved to your USB\\
$\quad$ \textbf{-} Need to be able to write down the filepath. This is usually shortest and easiest if saved to a USB stick\\
$\quad$ \textbf{-} The .txt file that includes the data has to contain equal numbers of evenly spaced columns. This can get a bit fiddly in large problems.
\end{enumerate}





## R Studio {.smaller}

IDE
