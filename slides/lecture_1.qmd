## The nature of Statistics
### Statistics is a mathematical subject

- Maths skills will give you a head start

- There are other occasions where common sense and *detective skills* can be more important

- Provides an early example of mathematics working in concert with the available computation




## The nature of Statistics
### We will use a combination of hand calculation and software

- Recognises that you are maths students
- Software (R) is really useful, particularly for dissertations
- Please bring your laptop into class
- Download R onto your laptop







## Overview of the module


Module has **11 Lectures**, divided into two parts:

- **Part I** - Mathematical statistics

- **Part II** - Applied statistics





## Overview of the module
### Part I - Mathematical statistics

1. Introduction to statistics
2. Normal distribution family and one-sample hypothesis tests
3. Two-sample hypothesis tests
4. The chi-squared test
5. Non-parametric statistics
6. The maths of regression





## Overview of the module
### Part II - Applied statistics


7. An introduction to practical regression
8. The extra sum of squares principle and regression modelling assumptions
9. Violations of regression assumptions -- Autocorrelation
10. Violation of regression assumptions -- Multicollinearity
10. Dummy variable regression models 





# Part 2: <br>Motivation {background-color="#cc0164" visibility="uncounted"}



## Simple but useful questions {.smaller}


::: {.column width="48%"}

**Generic data:**

- What is a *typical* observation
  * What is the **mean**?

- How spread out is the data?
  * What is the **variance**?

:::


::: {.column width="48%"}

**Regression:**

- What happens to $Y$ as $X$ increases?
  * increases?
  * decreases?
  * nothing?

:::


<br>

**Statistics answers these questions systematically**

- important for large datasets
- The same mathematical machinery (normal family of distributions) can be applied to both questions




## Analysing a general dataset

**Two basic questions:**

1. Location or mean
2. Spread or variance


**Statistics enables to answer systematically:**

1. One sample and two-sample $t$-test
2. Chi-squared test and $F$-test





## Recall the following sketch

## Motivating regression


**Basic question in regression:**

- What happens to $Y$ as $X$ increases?

  * increases?
  * decreases?
  * nothing?


**In this way regression can be seen as a more advanced version of high-school maths**







## Positive gradient

As $X$ increases $Y$ increases

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-asp: 1


# Create a scatter plot with no data points (type = "n")
plot(
  1, 1, 
  type = "n", 
  xlab = "X", 
  ylab = "Y", 
  xlim = c(0, 5), 
  ylim = c(0, 5), 
  frame.plot = TRUE, 
  axes = FALSE, 
  asp = 1)

# Add the line y = x
abline(
  a = 0, 
  b = 1, 
  col = "black", 
  lwd = 2)

```




## Negative gradient

As $X$ increases $Y$ decreases

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-asp: 1


# Create a scatter plot with no data points (type = "n")
plot(
  1, 1, 
  type = "n", 
  xlab = "X", 
  ylab = "Y", 
  xlim = c(-3, 3), 
  ylim = c(-3, 3), 
  frame.plot = TRUE, 
  axes = FALSE, 
  asp = 1)

# Add the line y = x
abline(
  a = 0, 
  b = -1, 
  col = "black", 
  lwd = 2)

```





## Zero gradient

Changes in $X$ do not affect $Y$

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-asp: 1


# Create a scatter plot with no data points (type = "n")
plot(
  1, 1, 
  type = "n", 
  xlab = "X", 
  ylab = "Y", 
  xlim = c(0, 5), 
  ylim = c(0, 5), 
  frame.plot = TRUE, 
  axes = FALSE, 
  asp = 1)

# Add the line y = x
abline(
  a = 2.5, 
  b = 0, 
  col = "black", 
  lwd = 2)

```
